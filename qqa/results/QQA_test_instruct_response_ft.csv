"<s> [INST] Answer this question given two options: A bowling ball can be thrown down a gree alley or a yellow alley. When it goes down the green alley, it generates 3 J heat and when it is thrown down the yellow alley it generates 2 KJ. Compared to the yellow alley, the bowling ball thrown down the green alley will go a distance that is?  Option 1: shorter. Option 2: farther [/INST] Option 1: shorter.

When the bowling ball is thrown down the green alley, it generates more heat than when it is thrown down the yellow alley. This means that the green alley has a higher friction coefficient, which means that the ball will slow down more quickly. As a result, the ball will go a shorter distance when thrown down the green alley compared to the yellow alley."
