0,"  To determine who went further, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each person.

Tina's cruise is 28 hours long, so she traveled for 28 hours x 35 mph = 940 miles.

Maria's cruise is 2 days long, so she traveled for 2 days x 35 mph = 700 miles.

Therefore, Maria went further than Tina. The correct answer is Option 2: Maria."
1,"  Based on the information provided, the correct answer is Option 1: less resistance.

When Lyle drives his jeep on the concrete, it moves at an average speed of 39 km/hr. This means that the jeep is able to move more easily and with less resistance on the concrete compared to the sand. The resistance faced by the jeep on the concrete is lower, which results in a higher average speed.

On the other hand, when Lyle drives the jeep on the sand, it moves at an average speed of 28 km/hr. This indicates that the jeep encounters more resistance when driving on the sand compared to the concrete, which results in a lower average speed.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: less resistance."
2,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to convert both weights to the same unit of measurement, such as pounds or kilograms.

The runner's weight is 43 pounds, which is equal to 19.5 kilograms (43 / 2.2 = 19.5).

The person's weight is 27 kilograms, which is equal to 59.5 pounds (27 / 2.2 = 59.5).

Now, we can compare the two weights:

The runner's weight is 19.5 kilograms, and the person's weight is 59.5 kilograms.

Therefore, the runner is more strong than the person. Option 2 is the correct answer."
3,"  Based on the information provided, the Lamborghini weighs 1485 kg and the truck weighs around 8845 kg. To determine which option is faster in the race, we need to calculate the acceleration of each vehicle.

Acceleration is calculated by dividing the change in velocity by the time it takes to achieve that change in velocity. In this case, let's assume the race is 100 meters long.

For the Lamborghini:

* Initial velocity = 0 km/h (since it's starting from rest)
* Final velocity = 100 km/h (since it needs to cover 100 meters in 100 seconds)
* Time = 100 seconds
* Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (100 km/h - 0 km/h) / 100 seconds = 100 km/h^2

For the truck:

* Initial velocity = 0 km/h (since it's starting from rest)
* Final velocity = 8845 km/h (since it needs to cover 100 meters in 100 seconds)
* Time = 100 seconds
* Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (8845 km/h - 0 km/h) / 100 seconds = 8845 km/h^2
"
4,"  Option 2: The sports car would likely take off more speedily.

Here's why:

The tractor trailer is much larger and heavier than the sports car, which means it will have more inertia and momentum. This means it will take longer for the tractor trailer to accelerate from a stop, especially compared to a smaller and lighter vehicle like the sports car. Additionally, the tractor trailer's larger size and weight will create more drag, which will slow it down even more.

On the other hand, the sports car is much smaller and lighter, which means it will have less inertia and momentum to overcome. This means it will be able to accelerate more quickly from a stop, especially compared to the tractor trailer. Additionally, the sports car's smaller size and lighter weight will create less drag, which will allow it to reach higher speeds more quickly.

So, while the tractor trailer may have a slight advantage at the start of the race due to its larger size and weight, the sports car will likely pull ahead more quickly as it accelerates."
5,"  Based on the information provided, the surface that is more smooth is the roof.

According to James' observations, the rain travels over the driveway in 5 seconds, which means that the driveway is rougher than the roof. If the driveway were perfectly smooth, the rain would take the same amount of time to travel over it as it does over the roof. However, since the driveway is bumpy, it takes longer for the rain to travel over it.

On the other hand, the rain travels over the roof in 10 seconds, which is faster than the driveway. This suggests that the roof is smoother than the driveway, as the rain is able to travel more quickly over it.

Therefore, based on James' observations, the roof is more smooth than the driveway."
6,"  Given the information provided, the more powerful window is the blue window.

The green window needs 8 punches to break, which means it takes 8 times as much effort to break it as it takes to break the blue window. Therefore, the blue window is the more powerful window.

So, the answer is Option 2: blue window."
7,"  Based on the information provided, the more powerful window is the blue window.

According to the scenario, the green window needs 3 punches to break, which means it can be broken with 3 punches. However, Bill is unable to break the blue window, which means it is more powerful than the green window and cannot be broken by any number of punches. Therefore, the blue window is the more powerful window."
8,"  Given the information provided, the coaster will heat up more over the coffee table than over the dining table.

Option 1: More

As Milo is sliding the coaster at a speed of 2000 cm/s over the coffee table, the coaster will experience a lot of friction and heat buildup due to the rough surface of the coffee table. This means that the coaster will heat up more over the coffee table than over the dining table, where the surface is smoother and there is less friction. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer.

Option 2: Less

On the other hand, if Milo is sliding the coaster at a speed of 5 m/s over the dining table, the coaster will experience less friction and heat buildup due to the smoother surface of the dining table. This means that the coaster will heat up less over the dining table than over the coffee table. Therefore, option 2 is the incorrect answer."
9,"  To determine which will take longer to get across the tree trunk, we need to calculate the time it would take each to cover the distance.

The distance the worm needs to travel is 4 mm/s x 5 seconds = 20 mm.

The distance the caterpillar needs to travel is 2 mm/s x 5 seconds = 10 mm.

Therefore, the worm will take longer to get across the tree trunk, as it needs 20 mm to cover the distance, while the caterpillar needs only 10 mm.

So, the answer is Option 1: worm."
10,"  Based on the information provided, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet.

The thickness of a business card is 0.1 inch, which means it has a thickness of 0.0001 feet.

On the other hand, the thickness of a cardboard sheet is 0.2 inch, which means it has a thickness of 0.0002 feet.

Since 0.0001 feet is less than 0.0002 feet, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: cardboard sheet."
11,"  Based on the information provided, the tortoise will take longer to get home. The tortoise has a speed of 113 cm/s, which is slower than the hare's speed of 36 cm/s. Therefore, the hare will take less time to get home than the tortoise.

So, the answer is Option 2: Hare."
12,"  Based on the information provided, John is much less strong than the person whose weight is 79 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: less."
13,"  Based on the information provided, the butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes.

According to the question, the butterfly can fly at a speed of 6 miles per hour through open air, which means it generates a certain amount of heat due to its motion. However, when flying through bushes, the butterfly's speed increases to 10 miles per hour, which means it generates more heat due to the increased air resistance.

Therefore, the option that results in the butterfly creating less heat is option 1: bushes."
14,"  Option 2: The sports car would likely take off more speedily.

Here's why:

The tractor trailer is much larger and heavier than the sports car, which means it will have more inertia and momentum. This means it will take longer for the tractor trailer to accelerate from a stop, especially compared to a smaller and lighter vehicle like the sports car. Additionally, the tractor trailer will likely have a lower power-to-weight ratio than the sports car, which means it will take more power to move the tractor trailer than the sports car.

On the other hand, the sports car is smaller and lighter, which means it will have less inertia and momentum to overcome. This means it will be able to accelerate more quickly from a stop, especially compared to the larger and heavier tractor trailer. Additionally, the sports car will likely have a higher power-to-weight ratio than the tractor trailer, which means it will be able to generate more power relative to its weight.

So, while the tractor trailer may have a slight advantage in terms of sheer size and weight, the sports car will likely be able to take off more speedily due to its smaller size and lighter weight."
15,"  Based on the information provided, the option that offers more resistance to the spider's temperature change is:

Option 1: web.

The temperature of the spider decreases by 9°F (5°C) when it scurries across a web, indicating that the web provides more resistance to temperature change than the tree."
16,"  Based on the information provided, the sales counter was the smoother of the two surfaces.

The distance the receipt slid across the sales counter (167 cm) is greater than the distance it slid across the floor (123 cm), indicating that the sales counter was smoother. Therefore, Option 1 (sales counter) is the correct answer."
17,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative velocity. The relative velocity between the two robins is the velocity of the female robin minus the velocity of the male robin.

Let's assume the velocity of the male robin is ""m"" km/h and the velocity of the female robin is ""f"" km/h. Since both robins are flying south at the same velocity, the relative velocity between them is:

Relative velocity = f - m

Since the male robin stopped to rest after 3 hours, he traveled a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = m x 3 = 3m km

On the other hand, the female robin stopped to rest after 42 minutes, so she traveled a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = f x 42 = 42f km

Now, we need to find out which robin covered more distance. To do this, we can divide the distance traveled by each robin by their relative velocity:

Male robin: Distance / Relative velocity = 3m / (f - m)
Female robin: Distance / Relative velocity = 42f / (f - m)

Solving for the relative velocity, we get:

f - m = 3 / 42

f = 5m

Therefore, the female robin covered more distance than the male robin."
18,"  Based on the information provided, the surface that is more smooth is the driveway.

According to James' observation, the rain travels over the driveway in 17 seconds, which is a relatively short time compared to the 0.5 minutes it takes to travel over the bumpy shingles of his house's roof. This suggests that the driveway is smoother than the roof, as the rain can travel more quickly and easily over a smooth surface than over a bumpy one.

Therefore, the answer is Option 1: roof."
19,"  Based on the information provided, the rocky yard is more rough than the swept yard.

According to the passage, a boxer dog can run at a speed of 30 mph in a swept yard, which suggests that the surface is relatively smooth and easy to run on. In contrast, the passage states that a boxer dog can run at a speed of 20 mph in a rocky yard, which implies that the surface is more difficult and rougher to run on. Therefore, option 2 (rocky yard) is the correct answer."
20,"  To determine which of the two animals will take longer to get home, we need to convert their speeds to the same unit of measurement, let's say meters per second (m/s).

The tortoise has a speed of 2 m/s, which means it will take:

2 m/s x 500 m (distance between the school house and their home) = 1000 seconds

The hare has a speed of 21 cm/s, which means it will take:

21 cm/s x 500 m = 10,500 seconds

Therefore, the hare will take longer to get home than the tortoise. So, the answer is Option 2: Hare."
21,"  Based on the information provided, the correct answer is Option 2: more resistance.

When Lyle drives the jeep on the sand, it moves at a speed of 32 km/hr, which is slower than the speed of 56 km/hr it moves on the concrete. This means that the sand provides more resistance to the jeep's movement than the concrete does."
22,"  Option 2: The sports car would likely take off more speedily.

The dimensions of the Italian model sports car are relatively small compared to the size of the tractor trailer. The sports car is only 4,527 mm long, 1,937 mm wide, and 1,213 mm tall, which is much smaller than the tractor trailer's dimensions of 48 feet x 7.5 feet x 8 feet. This means that the sports car has a smaller overall volume and weight, which would make it more agile and better suited for quick acceleration.

In contrast, the tractor trailer is much larger and heavier, with a larger volume and weight. This would make it more difficult for the tractor trailer to quickly accelerate from a stop, especially compared to the smaller and lighter sports car. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer."
23,"  To determine who went further, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each person.

Tina's cruise is 18 hours long, so she traveled for 18 hours x 35 mph = 630 miles.

Maria's cruise is 2 days long, so she traveled for 2 days x 35 mph = 700 miles.

Therefore, Maria went further than Tina. The correct answer is Option 2: Maria."
24,"  Both options are incorrect.

The apple is actually closer to Harry than the watermelon. The apple is 5 meters away, while the watermelon is 11 feet away, which is equivalent to 3.3 meters (since there are 3 feet in 1 meter). So, the apple looks larger than the watermelon.

Option 1 is incorrect because the watermelon is actually closer to Harry than the apple.

Option 2 is incorrect because the apple is closer to Harry than the watermelon, not the other way around."
25,"  Based on the information provided, the shopping cart moves faster over the door mat than over the tile floor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 2: Tile floor.

As the shopping cart moves over the tile floor, it encounters more friction than over the door mat, resulting in a slower speed."
26,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy of an object remains constant in a closed system. In this case, the energy of the bowling ball is given by the equation:

E = 5J (for the green alley) or E = 3J (for the yellow alley)

Since the total energy of the bowling ball is constant, we can set up the following equation:

5J = E (for the green alley) or 3J = E (for the yellow alley)

Solving for E, we get:

E = 5J / 5 = 1J (for the green alley) or E = 3J / 3 = 1J (for the yellow alley)

Therefore, the distance traveled by the bowling ball is the same in both alleys, so the answer is Option 2: farther."
27,"  Based on the information provided, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet.

The business card has a thickness of 1 cm, which means it has a thickness of 0.1 meters.

The cardboard sheet has a width and thickness of 3 cm, which means it has a width of 0.3 meters and a thickness of 0.3 meters.

Since the business card is thinner than the cardboard sheet, it is less strong than the cardboard sheet. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: business card."
28,"  Based on the information provided, the dirt road has more friction than the paved road. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more friction.

The statement ""A car heats up in 41 mins when driving on a dirt road, whereas it heats up in 1.5 hrs driving on a paved road"" implies that the car heats up faster on the dirt road than on the paved road. This is because more friction is generated on the dirt road, which causes the car to heat up more quickly."
29,"  In this case, the watermelon looks larger.

The distance from Harry to the apple is 15 meters, which is equal to 15 x 0.1 = 1.5 meters.

The distance from Harry to the watermelon is 110 cm, which is equal to 0.11 meters.

Since the distance from Harry to the watermelon is smaller than the distance from Harry to the apple, the watermelon appears larger.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: watermelon."
30,"  According to the inverse-square law of light, the street light that is 0.2 miles away will appear brighter than the street light that is 3 miles away.

The inverse-square law states that the intensity of light decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the source of light. In other words, as the distance from the light source increases, the intensity of the light decreases.

So, in this case, the street light that is 0.2 miles away is closer to John than the street light that is 3 miles away. Therefore, the street light that is 0.2 miles away will appear brighter to John than the street light that is 3 miles away.

So, the correct answer is Option 1: Street light that is 0.2 mile away."
31,"  Given the information provided, the car accelerated slower.

The car had a weight of 3270 pounds, and the full dump truck had a weight of 68794 pounds. To determine the acceleration of the car, we can use the formula:

Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time

Since the car's velocity increased from 0 to 68794 pounds (the full dump truck's weight), and the time taken to accelerate is 1 second, the acceleration can be calculated as:

Acceleration = 68794 pounds / 1 second = 68794 pounds/second

Since the car's weight is much smaller than the full dump truck's weight, the car will accelerate slower than the full dump truck. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: slower."
32,"  To determine which surface was smoother, we need to compare the distance traveled by the receipt on each surface.

The receipt traveled a distance of 1 m and 45 cm when it slid across the sales counter.

The distance traveled by the receipt on the floor was 45 cm.

Therefore, the floor was the smoother of the two surfaces, as it took the receipt less distance to travel the same distance."
33,"  Based on the information provided, the trolley will be able to go a greater distance on the rusted tracks.

The friction force on the rusted tracks is greater than the friction force on the new tracks, so the trolley will experience more resistance when moving along the rusted tracks. This means that the trolley will have to use more energy to overcome the friction force and maintain its speed, which will result in a shorter distance traveled.

On the other hand, the trolley will experience less friction force on the new tracks, which means it will be able to move more easily and travel a greater distance.

Therefore, the answer is Option 1: rusted tracks."
34,"  To determine the distance the trolley can go on each set of tracks, we need to calculate the total force acting on the trolley for each set of tracks.

For the new tracks, the friction force is 247 N. Therefore, the total force acting on the trolley on the new tracks is:

Total force = Friction force = 247 N

For the rusted tracks, the friction force is half of 342 N, which is:

Friction force = 0.5 x 342 N = 171 N

Therefore, the total force acting on the trolley on the rusted tracks is:

Total force = Friction force = 171 N

Now, we can use the formula:

Distance = Force x Speed

to find the distance the trolley can go on each set of tracks:

Distance (new tracks) = Total force x Speed
= 247 N x?

Distance (rusted tracks) = Total force x Speed
= 171 N x?

Since the trolley is traveling at a constant speed on both sets of tracks, we can use the same speed for both calculations:

Speed = 5 m/s

Now we can plug the values into the formulas:

Distance (new tracks) = 247 N x 5 m/s ="
35,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of work and energy. The work done on the bowling ball by the friction in the two alleys can be calculated using the following formula:

Work = Force x Distance

In this case, the force acting on the bowling ball is equal to the weight of the ball, which is approximately 0.1 kg for a standard bowling ball. The distance traveled by the ball in each alley can be calculated using the following formulas:

Distance = Work / Force

For the green alley:

Distance = 14 J / 0.1 kg = 14 m

For the yellow alley:

Distance = 6 J / 0.1 kg = 6 m

Now, we need to compare the distances traveled by the bowling ball in each alley. The distance traveled by the ball in the green alley is longer than the distance traveled by the ball in the yellow alley, so the correct answer is:

Option 2: farther

Therefore, the bowling ball thrown down the green alley will go a distance that is farther than the distance it goes in the yellow alley."
36,"  To determine who went further, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each person.

Tina's cruise is 6 hours long, so she traveled for 6 hours x 35 mph = 210 miles.

Maria's cruise is 13 hours long, so she traveled for 13 hours x 35 mph = 465 miles.

Therefore, Maria went further than Tina. The correct answer is Option 2: Maria."
37,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy of an object remains constant in a closed system. In this case, the energy of the bowling ball is given by the equation:

E = 3J + 2KJ

where E is the energy of the bowling ball, J is the energy generated by the ball as it travels down the green alley, and K is the energy generated by the ball as it travels down the yellow alley.

Since the total energy of the bowling ball is constant, we can set up the following equation:

3J + 2KJ = E

Solving for J, we get:

J = E - 2KJ

Now, we are given that the energy of the bowling ball when it goes down the green alley is 3J, and the energy of the bowling ball when it goes down the yellow alley is 2KJ. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

3J = E - 2KJ

Subtracting 2KJ from both sides gives us:

J = E - 2KJ

Now, we are asked to compare the distance traveled by the bowling ball when it is thrown down the green alley versus the yellow"
38,"  Based on the information provided, the shopping cart moves at a faster speed (8 m/s) on the tile floor than on the door mat (5 m/s). Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: tile floor."
39,"  Based on the information provided, the option that offers more resistance to a spider's temperature change is:

Option 2: tree.

According to the passage, the temperature of a spider scurrying across a tree becomes 74 F, which is higher than the temperature of a spider scurrying across a web, which becomes 37 C. This suggests that the tree offers more resistance to the spider's temperature change than the web does."
40,"  Based on the information provided, the Lamborghini weighs 1649 kg and the class 1 light truck weighs around 1386 kg. To determine which vehicle accelerated faster in a race, we need to calculate their acceleration rates.

Assuming both vehicles start from rest and accelerate at the same rate, we can use the following formula to calculate their acceleration:

Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time taken

For the Lamborghini:

Change in velocity = 1649 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity) = 1617.2 m/s^2
Time taken = Distance / Acceleration = 0 m (starting from rest) / 1617.2 m/s^2 = 0 s

For the class 1 light truck:

Change in velocity = 1386 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 1353.2 m/s^2
Time taken = Distance / Acceleration = 0 m (starting from rest) / 1353.2 m/s^2 = 0 s

Since both vehicles accelerated at the same rate (9.8 m/s^2), they both reached their top speed in 0 seconds. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 2: Faster

So, the Lamborg"
41,"  To determine who has a bigger gravity pull, we need to calculate their body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of a person's weight in relation to their height.

Elliot weighs 137 pounds and is 5 feet 8 inches tall, so his BMI is:

BMI = weight (in pounds) / height (in inches) squared
= 137 / (58 x 58) = 23.5

Leon weighs 142 pounds and is 5 feet 9 inches tall, so his BMI is:

BMI = weight (in pounds) / height (in inches) squared
= 142 / (59 x 59) = 24.2

Since Leon's BMI is higher than Elliot's, Leon has a bigger gravity pull. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: Leon."
42,"  Based on the information provided, the sled slid slower on the grass. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: the grass."
43,"  To determine which will take longer to get across the tree trunk, we need to calculate the time it would take each to cover the distance.

The distance the worm needs to travel is 40 mm/s x 100 s = 4000 mm.

The distance the caterpillar needs to travel is 3 cm/s x 100 s = 300 cm.

Therefore, the caterpillar will take longer to get across the tree trunk, as it needs to cover a longer distance. Option 2 is the correct answer."
44,"  Based on the information provided, the sled slid faster on the grass.

According to the question, the sled slid with a speed of 110 cm/s on the smoother surface, which is the ice. However, when Tim moved the sled to the rougher surface, which is the grass, the sled slid with a speed of 43 cm/s. This means that the sled slid faster on the grass than on the ice. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: the grass."
45,"  To determine which person has a smaller gravity pull, we need to calculate their body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of a person's weight in relation to their height.

Elliot weighs 174 pounds and is 74 inches tall, so his BMI is:

BMI = weight (in pounds) / height (in inches)²
BMI = 174 / (74 x 74) = 27.4

Leon weighs 163 pounds and is 72 inches tall, so his BMI is:

BMI = weight (in pounds) / height (in inches)²
BMI = 163 / (72 x 72) = 26.7

Since Elliot's BMI is higher than Leon's BMI, Elliot has a larger gravity pull. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: Elliot."
46,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of work and energy. The work done on the bowling ball by the friction in the alley is given by the formula:

Work = Force x Distance

In this case, the force acting on the bowling ball is equal to the weight of the ball, which is approximately 0.25 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 (assuming the ball is made of a material with a density of approximately 1.3 g/cm^3).

For the green alley, the distance traveled by the bowling ball is 0.2 KJ, so the work done on the ball is:

Work (green alley) = Force x Distance = 0.25 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 x 0.2 km = 0.048 J

For the yellow alley, the distance traveled by the bowling ball is 0.06 KJ, so the work done on the ball is:

Work (yellow alley) = Force x Distance = 0.25 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 x 0.06 km = 0.0072 J

Since the work done on the ball is greater in the green alley"
47,"  Based on the information provided, the runner whose weight was 27 pounds is much less strong than the guy who had a weight of 69 pounds. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: less."
48,"  Based on the information provided, the rougher surface is the floor.

The receipt slid a distance of 4 meters across the sales counter, which means it traveled a distance of 4 meters in a straight line. However, when it slid across the floor, it traveled an additional distance of 2 meters, for a total distance of 6 meters. This suggests that the floor was rougher than the sales counter, as the receipt had to travel a longer distance on the floor to cover the same distance. Therefore, Option 2 (the floor) is the rougher of the two surfaces."
49,"  Based on the information provided, the rocky yard is less rough than the swept yard.

According to the passage, a boxer dog can run at a speed of 48 mph in a swept yard, which means the surface is smooth and flat. In contrast, the boxer dog can run at a speed of 37 mph in a rocky yard, which is a rougher surface. Therefore, option 2 (rocky yard) is the correct answer."
50,"  Given the information provided, the more powerful window is the blue window.

Option 1: Green window

* Bill punches a green window and it needs 2 punches to break.
* Bill punches the green window and it breaks.

Option 2: Blue window

* Bill punches a blue window and it needs 2 punches each from him and his friend to break.
* Bill punches the blue window and it breaks.

In both cases, the window breaks after 2 punches, so they are equally powerful. However, since Bill punches the blue window with his friend's help, it is more powerful than the green window that Bill punched alone. Therefore, the more powerful window is the blue window."
51,"  Given the information provided, the best option for Howard's new bed frame is Option 2: thin.

A bed frame that is too thick may not be able to hold a weight of 12 kg, as it may not have enough structural integrity to support that amount of weight. On the other hand, a thin bed frame may be more likely to be able to hold the weight of 12 kg, as it will have a smaller cross-sectional area and therefore less material to fail under the weight.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the best option for Howard is a thin bed frame."
52,"  To determine who went further, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each person.

Tina's cruise is 4 hours long, so she traveled for 4 hours x 35 mph = 140 miles.

Maria's cruise is 2 hours long, so she traveled for 2 hours x 35 mph = 70 miles.

Therefore, Maria went further than Tina. The correct answer is Option 2: Maria."
53,"  Based on the information provided, the train generated more heat on the tracks.

The speed of the train on pavement was 24 kph, which is approximately 15 mph. On the train tracks, the speed was 24 mph, which is the same as the speed on the pavement. However, the train generates more heat when it is moving at a higher speed, which is the case on the tracks compared to the pavement. Therefore, option 2: tracks is the correct answer."
54,"  Given the weight of 220 kg that Howard needed the bed frame to hold, the best option is:

Option 2: Thin.

A thin bed frame would be more likely to be able to support a weight of 220 kg than a thick one. Thin frames are typically made of lightweight materials and are designed to be more flexible and durable, which makes them better suited for holding heavy weights. Thick frames, on the other hand, are typically made of heavier materials and are designed to provide more support and stability, which may not be necessary for a weight of 220 kg."
55,"  Based on the information provided, the cherry will heat up less on flat ground.

The distance the cherry can roll on flat ground is 9 cm, which is greater than the distance it can roll on a slope of 3 cm. This means that the cherry will have more distance to roll on flat ground before it comes to a stop, which will result in less heating up due to friction.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: flat ground."
56,"  Option 2: matte table.

When you slide a lunch bag across a shiny table, the bag will experience more friction and heat buildup due to the smooth surface. This means that the bottom of the bag will get hotter as it slides across the table. On the other hand, sliding the bag across a matte table will create less friction and heat buildup, resulting in a cooler bottom. Therefore, the matte table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler."
57,"  Option 2: Street light that is 2 miles away will appear brighter to John.

The distance of an object from an observer can affect how bright it appears. The farther away an object is, the smaller it appears and the less light it reflects to the observer. Therefore, the street light that is 2 miles away will appear brighter to John than the one that is 7 m away, because it is farther away and will appear larger and more intense in the distance."
58,"  Based on the information provided, the butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes.

According to the question, the butterfly can fly at a speed of 11 miles per hour through open air, which means it creates a certain amount of drag and heat due to air resistance. However, when flying through bushes, the butterfly's speed is reduced to 14.48 km per hour, which is slower than its speed through open air. As a result, the butterfly creates less heat while flying through the bushes than it would through open air.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: bushes."
59,"  Based on the information provided, the hare (36 cm/s) is faster than the tortoise (13 cm/s), so the hare will take less time to get home than the tortoise. Therefore, the answer is Option 2: Hare."
60,"  Based on the information provided, the shopping cart moves faster over the door mat than over the tile floor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 1: door mat.

The shopping cart moves at a speed of 26 m/s over the door mat, and at a speed of 19 m/s over the tile floor. This means that the door mat provides less friction than the tile floor, causing the cart to move faster over the door mat."
61,"  Based on the information provided, the butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes.

The speed of a butterfly through open air is 12 miles per hour, while the speed through bushes is 8 miles per hour. This means that the butterfly is moving slower through the bushes than through open air, which implies that it is creating less heat while flying through the bushes.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: bushes."
62,"  Based on the information provided, the correct answer is Option 2: more resistance.

When Lyle drives his jeep on the concrete, it moves at an average speed of 40 km/hr. This means that the jeep is able to move smoothly and efficiently on the concrete surface, with less resistance.

On the other hand, when Lyle drives the jeep on the sand, it moves at a slower speed of 20 km/hr. This indicates that the jeep is encountering more resistance when driving on the sand compared to the concrete surface. The sand provides more friction and resistance to the jeep's movement, which slows it down.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more resistance."
63,"  To determine which insect will seem bigger to Jimbo, we need to use the concept of perspective in visual perception.

When Jimbo is 21 feet away from the beetle, the beetle will appear smaller to him compared to when he is 903 feet away from the grasshopper. This is because the farther Jimbo is from an object, the smaller it appears.

Therefore, the option that seems bigger to Jimbo is Option 2: grasshopper."
64,"  To determine which road is more rough, we need to compare the distance the beach ball travels on each road.

On the gravel road, the beach ball traveled 12 meters.
On the asphalt road, the beach ball traveled 26 meters.

Therefore, the asphalt road is more rough than the gravel road, as the beach ball traveled farther on the asphalt road.

So, the correct answer is Option 1: gravel."
65,"  Based on the information provided, the butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes.

According to the passage, the butterfly can fly at a speed of 23.57 miles per hour through open air, which means it generates a significant amount of heat due to friction with the surrounding air molecules. However, when flying through bushes, the butterfly's speed is reduced to 13 miles per hour, which results in less heat being generated due to the reduced air resistance. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer."
66,"  Based on the information provided, the sled slid faster on the grass.

According to the question, the sled slid with a speed of 19 m/s on the smoother surface, which is likely to be ice. However, when Tim moved the sled to the rougher surface, which is the grass, the sled slid with a speed of 11 m/s. This means that the sled slid faster on the grass than on the ice. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: the grass."
67,"  Based on the information provided, the rocky yard is more rough than the swept yard.

According to the passage, the boxer dog can run at a speed of 43 kmph (or 29.04 mph) in a rocky yard. This is faster than the speed of 29.04 mph that the dog can run in a swept yard. Therefore, the rocky yard is more rough than the swept yard.

So, the correct answer is Option 1: rocky yard."
68,"  Given the information provided, the coaster will heat up less over the dining table than over the coffee table.

Option 2: less

Explanation:

When Milo slides the coaster over the coffee table at a speed of 0.6 m/s, the coaster will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 0.6 m/s x 2 seconds = 1.2 meters

Since the coaster is made of a material that can absorb heat, it will heat up during the journey. The amount of heat absorbed can be calculated using the formula:

Heat absorbed = Distance x Heat capacity

Heat capacity is a property of the material and is typically measured in Joules per kilogram (J/kg). For a typical coaster material, the heat capacity is around 0.1 J/kg.

Heat absorbed = 1.2 meters x 0.1 J/kg = 0.12 J

Now, when Milo slides the coaster over the dining table at a speed of 1.8 m/s, the coaster will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 1.8 m/s x 2 seconds = 3.6 meters

Again, the coaster will absorb heat during the journey, and the amount of heat absorbed can be calculated using"
69,"  Based on the information provided, the Lamborghini weighs 1438 kg and the class 1 light truck weighs around 1273 kg. To determine which vehicle accelerated faster in a race, we need to calculate their acceleration rates.

Assuming both vehicles start from rest and accelerate at the same rate, we can calculate their acceleration rates using the following formula:

Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time taken

For the Lamborghini:

Change in velocity = 1273 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity) = 1255 m/s^2
Time taken = Distance / Acceleration rate = 1000 m / 1255 m/s^2 = 0.8 seconds

For the class 1 light truck:

Change in velocity = 1273 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 1255 m/s^2
Time taken = Distance / Acceleration rate = 1000 m / 1255 m/s^2 = 0.8 seconds

Since both vehicles take the same time (0.8 seconds) to accelerate from rest to 1000 m, they accelerate at the same rate. Therefore, the answer is Option 2: faster."
70,"  Based on the information provided, the cherry will heat up less on the flat ground.

The distance the cherry can roll on flat ground is 4 m, which is much greater than the distance it can roll on the slope of 433 cm. This means that the cherry will have more distance to cover on flat ground before it reaches the end of its roll, which means it will have more time to lose heat through friction with the ground.

On the other hand, the cherry rolling on the slope will reach the end of its roll more quickly, as it has a shorter distance to cover. This means that the cherry will heat up more quickly and lose less heat through friction with the ground.

Therefore, the answer is option 2: flat ground."
71,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to compare the weights of Robin and John.

Robin's weight is 23 kg, and John's weight is 29 kg.

So, John is heavier than Robin by 6 kg (29 - 23 = 6).

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: less."
72,"  To spend less time on a trip from city to city in Japan, the traveler should choose the bullet train.

The bullet train can travel at a speed of 8 meters per second, which is much slower than the speed of a car, which can travel at 29 meters per second. This means that the bullet train will take longer to cover the same distance as a car.

For example, let's say the distance between the two cities is 100 kilometers. If the traveler takes the bullet train, it will take 100/8 = 12.5 hours to cover the distance. If the traveler takes a car, it will take 100/29 = 3.4 hours to cover the distance.

Therefore, the bullet train will take longer to reach the destination than the car, so the traveler should choose the car if they want to spend less time on their trip."
73,"  Based on the information provided, the dirt road has more friction than the paved road. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more friction.

The fact that the car heats up faster on the dirt road than on the paved road suggests that the dirt road is providing more resistance to the tires, which in turn is causing the car to generate more heat. This is consistent with the idea that more friction means more resistance, which can lead to increased heat buildup in the car."
74,"  To determine which will take longer to get across the tree trunk, we need to calculate the time it would take each to cover the distance.

The worm can travel at a speed of 4 cm/s, so it would take:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 10 cm (length of the tree trunk) / 4 cm/s
= 2.5 minutes

The caterpillar can travel at a speed of 32 cm/s, so it would take:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 10 cm (length of the tree trunk) / 32 cm/s
= 0.31 minutes

Therefore, the caterpillar will take longer to get across the tree trunk than the worm. Option 2 is the correct answer."
75,"  Based on the information provided, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet.

The business card has a thickness of 1.2 inches, which is equivalent to 0.03 inches or 0.76 cm.

The cardboard sheet, on the other hand, has a thickness of 1.2 cm, which is equivalent to 0.12 inches or 3.05 cm.

Therefore, the cardboard sheet is thicker than the business card, which means it is stronger.

So, the correct answer is Option 2: cardboard sheet."
76,"  Based on the information provided, the bus driver drove at a slower speed on the unpaved road (29 km/h) than on the dirt road (48 km/h). This suggests that the unpaved road had:

Option 2: Less friction.

The unpaved road had less friction than the dirt road, which allowed the bus to travel faster on the dirt road. Friction is the resistance that occurs when a vehicle moves over a surface, and it is affected by the surface's texture, roughness, and moisture content. Unpaved roads typically have less friction than paved roads because they are rougher and have more irregularities, which can cause the vehicle to lose traction and slow down."
77,"  Based on the information provided, the bus driver drove at a slower speed on the unpaved road (24 km/h) than on the dirt road (55 km/h) because the unpaved road had:

Option 2: Less friction.

The unpaved road had less friction than the dirt road, which means that the bus driver needed to drive slower on the unpaved road to maintain control and avoid skidding or losing traction. The dirt road, on the other hand, had more friction, which allowed the bus to drive faster."
78,"  Based on the information provided, the sled slid faster on the grass.

Option 1: The ice

The sled slid with a speed of 10 m/s on the smoother surface, which is the ice.

Option 2: The grass

The sled slid with a speed of 3 m/s on the rougher surface, which is the grass.

Therefore, the answer is Option 2: the grass."
79,"  Based on the information provided, the driveway is more smooth than the roof.

According to James' observations, the rain travels over the driveway in 14 seconds, which is faster than the 12 seconds it takes to travel over the bumpy shingles of his house's roof. This suggests that the driveway is smoother than the roof, as it takes less time for the rain to travel over a smoother surface.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: roof."
80,"  To determine which ball has stronger gravity, we need to calculate the gravitational force (or weight) of each ball.

The gravitational force of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (which is 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth). So, we can calculate the weight of each ball as follows:

Bowling ball:
mass = 14 ounces = 0.014 kg
weight = mass x acceleration = 0.014 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.36 N

Softball:
mass = 0.14417 kg = 14.417 grams
weight = mass x acceleration = 14.417 g x 9.8 m/s^2 = 13.6 N

As we can see, the softball has a greater weight than the bowling ball, so the softball has stronger gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: softball."
81,"  Based on the information provided, the dirt road has more friction than the paved road. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more friction.

The fact that the car heats up faster on the dirt road than on the paved road suggests that the dirt road is providing more resistance to the tires, which in turn is causing the car to generate more heat. This is consistent with the idea that the dirt road has more friction than the paved road."
82,"  To determine which road is more smooth, we need to compare the distance traveled by the beach ball on each road.

According to the question, the beach ball traveled 17 meters when kicked across the asphalt road and 11 meters when kicked across the gravel road. This means that the gravel road is more smooth than the asphalt road, as the beach ball traveled a shorter distance on the gravel road.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: gravel."
83,"  Given the information provided, the car accelerated slower.

The car had a weight of 4009 pounds, and the full dump truck had a weight of 56000 pounds. To determine the acceleration of the car, we can use the formula:

Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time

Since the car's velocity increased from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds, its acceleration can be calculated as:

Acceleration = 60 mph / 5 s = 12 mph/s^2

Since the full dump truck has a weight of 56000 pounds, its acceleration would be much slower than the car's acceleration. For example, if the full dump truck accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds, its acceleration would be:

Acceleration = 60 mph / 5 s = 12 mph/s^2

Therefore, the car accelerated faster than the full dump truck. The correct answer is Option 1: faster."
84,"  Based on the information provided, the cherry will heat up less on flat ground.

The distance the cherry can roll on flat ground is 12 cm, which is less than the distance it can roll on a slope of 43 cm. This means that the cherry will experience more friction and resistance when rolling on flat ground, which will cause it to heat up more. On the other hand, the cherry will experience less friction and resistance when rolling on a slope, which will cause it to heat up less. Therefore, option 2: flat ground is the correct answer."
85,"  Based on the information provided, the shopping cart moves faster over the door mat than over the tile floor.

As the shopping cart moves over the door mat, it experiences more friction due to the rougher surface of the mat. This results in a lower speed, which is 18 m/s in this case.

On the other hand, the shopping cart moves at a faster speed over the tile floor, which has a smoother surface than the door mat. This means that there is less friction on the tile floor, resulting in a higher speed of 3000 cm/s.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: tile floor."
86,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative velocity. The relative velocity between the two robins is the velocity of the female robin minus the velocity of the male robin.

Let's assume the velocity of the male robin is ""m"" km/h and the velocity of the female robin is ""f"" km/h. Since the male robin stopped to rest after 4 hours, it covered a distance of ""4h"" km during that time. Similarly, the female robin covered a distance of ""38 + 4h"" km during the same time period.

To find out which robin covered more distance, we need to find the difference in distance covered by each robin:

Distance covered by male robin = 4h km
Distance covered by female robin = 38 + 4h km

Now, we can find the difference in distance between the two robins:

Distance difference = distance covered by female robin - distance covered by male robin
= 38 + 4h - 4h
= 24h km

Therefore, the female robin covered more distance than the male robin.

So, the answer is Option 2: the female robin."
87,"  Based on the information provided, we can calculate the thickness of a business card and a cardboard sheet to determine which one is less strong.

The thickness of a business card is around double that of a cardboard sheet, which means the business card is 2 x 1.4 = 2.8 inches thick.

On the other hand, a cardboard sheet is typically around 0.08 inches thick.

Therefore, the cardboard sheet is less strong than a business card, as it has a thickness of 0.08 inches compared to the business card's thickness of 2.8 inches.

So, the answer is Option 2: cardboard sheet."
88,"  Based on the information provided, the trolley will be able to go a greater distance on the rusted tracks.

The friction force on the rusted tracks is 12 Mega Newtons, which is greater than the friction force on the new tracks, which is 17 N. This means that the trolley will have more traction and be able to go farther on the rusted tracks than on the new tracks.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: rusted tracks."
89,"  To spend less time on the trip from city to city, the traveler should choose the bullet train.

The bullet train can cover 29 kms in an hour, which means it can travel 29/1 = 29 kilometers per hour.

On the other hand, the car can cover 10 kms in an hour, which means it can travel 10/1 = 10 kilometers per hour.

Therefore, the bullet train will take less time to cover the same distance as the car, so it is the better option for the traveler who wants to spend less time on the trip."
90,"  Based on the information provided, the train generated more heat on the tracks.

The speed of the train on the tracks (60 kph) is higher than the speed on the pavement (10 kph), which means the train is moving faster and generating more kinetic energy. As the train moves faster, it also generates more frictional heat due to the resistance it encounters from the tracks. Therefore, option 2: tracks is the correct answer."
91,"  Option 2: grasshopper.

Since Jimbo is 14 feet away from the beetle and 19 inches away from the grasshopper, the grasshopper will seem bigger to him. The distance between Jimbo and the beetle is greater than the distance between Jimbo and the grasshopper, so the grasshopper will appear larger in relation to Jimbo."
92,"  Based on the information provided, the rocky yard is more rough than the swept yard.

According to the passage, a boxer dog can run at a speed of 57 mph in a rocky yard, which is higher than the speed of 53 mph it can reach in a swept yard. This suggests that the rocky yard provides a more challenging terrain for the dog to run on, resulting in a faster speed. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: rocky yard."
93,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to calculate the ratio of the weight of the car to the weight of the full dump truck.

The weight of the car is 44567 pounds, and the weight of the full dump truck is 6639 pounds.

So, the ratio of the weight of the car to the weight of the full dump truck is:

44567 / 6639 = 0.67

Since the ratio is greater than 1, the car accelerated slower than the full dump truck. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: slower."
94,"  To determine who has a bigger gravity pull, we need to consider the mass of each person. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull will be.

Elliot weighs 200 pounds, which means he has a mass of 200 pounds / 0.45359237 kilograms = 44.4 kilograms.

Leon weighs 170 pounds, which means he has a mass of 170 pounds / 0.45359237 kilograms = 37.4 kilograms.

Therefore, Leon has a bigger gravity pull than Elliot, because he has a greater mass. So the correct answer is Option 2: Leon."
95,"  Option 2: The sports car would likely take off more speedily.

The custom tractor trailer is much larger and heavier than the Italian model sports car, which means it would have a higher mass and less agility. This means that when the stoplight turned green, the sports car would be able to accelerate more quickly and easily due to its smaller size and lighter weight. Additionally, sports cars are typically designed for speed and agility, so they are better equipped to take advantage of the green light and get off the starting line quickly.

On the other hand, the tractor trailer is much larger and heavier, which would make it more difficult to accelerate quickly. Its larger size and weight would also make it more difficult to maneuver and change direction quickly, which could make it more difficult to take advantage of the green light.

Therefore, while both vehicles are waiting at the stoplight, the sports car is likely to be the one that takes off more speedily when the light turns green."
96,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to convert the weight of the car and the dump truck to the same unit.

1800 kg is equal to approximately 3970 pounds, so the weight of the dump truck is:

1800 kg = 3970 lb

Now, we can calculate the acceleration of the car:

Acceleration = (Change in velocity) / (Time taken)

Let's assume the car accelerated from a standstill to a speed of 60 mph (96.5 km/h) in 5 seconds.

Change in velocity = 60 mph - 0 mph = 60 mph

Time taken = 5 seconds

Acceleration = (60 mph) / (5 seconds) = 12 mph/s

Now, we can compare the acceleration of the car with the weight of the dump truck:

Acceleration of the car = 12 mph/s

Weight of the dump truck = 3970 lb

Therefore, the car accelerated faster than the weight of the dump truck.

So, the correct answer is:

Option 1: Faster."
97,"  To determine which ball has stronger gravity, we need to calculate the gravitational force (or weight) of each ball.

The gravitational force of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (which is 9.8 meters per second squared on Earth). So, we can calculate the weight of each ball as follows:

Bowling ball: mass = 12 ounces = 0.12 kg
Weight = mass x acceleration = 0.12 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.17 N

Softball: mass = 4 ounces = 0.04 kg
Weight = mass x acceleration = 0.04 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 0.43 N

As you can see, the bowling ball has a stronger gravitational force than the softball, so the answer is Option 1: softball."
98,"  Given the weight requirement of 22 kg, the best option for Howard would be Option 2: thin. A thin bed frame would be able to support the weight of 22 kg without compromising its structural integrity. A thick bed frame, on the other hand, might not be able to handle the weight and could potentially break or collapse under the pressure. Therefore, the best option for Howard is a thin bed frame."
99,"  Option 2: matte table

When you slide a lunch bag across a shiny table, the friction between the bag and the table will cause the bag to heat up due to the frictional forces. On the other hand, when you slide a lunch bag across a matte table, the friction will be less, and the bag will heat up less. Therefore, the matte table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler."
100,"  Based on the information provided, the sales counter was the smoother of the two surfaces.

The distance the receipt slid across the sales counter (300 cm) is greater than the distance it slid across the floor (245 cm), indicating that the sales counter was smoother. Therefore, Option 1 (sales counter) is the correct answer."
101,"  To determine which ball has stronger gravity, we need to calculate the gravitational force (or weight) of each ball.

The gravitational force is given by the equation:

F = G \* m \* M / r^2

where:

* F is the gravitational force (in Newtons)
* G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
* m is the mass of the object (in kg)
* M is the mass of the Earth (in kg)
* r is the distance between the object and the center of the Earth (in meters)

For the softball:

m = 2 ounces = 0.02 kg
M = 5.97 x 10^24 kg (the mass of the Earth)
r = 0.02 meters (the distance between the softball and the center of the Earth)

F = G \* m \* M / r^2 = 6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2 \* 0.02 kg \* 5.97 x 10^24 kg / (0.02 m)^2 = 0.000000002 N

For the bowling ball:

m = 4 ounces = 0.04 kg
M = "
102,"  To determine which road is more smooth, we need to compare the distance traveled by the beach ball on each road.

According to the question, the beach ball traveled 26.24 yards when kicked across the asphalt road and 13 meters when kicked across the gravel road. To convert meters to yards, we can use the conversion factor of 1 yard = 0.9144 meters.

So, the beach ball traveled 28.76 yards (26.24 yards x 1.0914 meters/yard) when kicked across the asphalt road and 14.3 meters (13 meters x 1.0914 meters/yard) when kicked across the gravel road.

Therefore, the gravel road is more smooth than the asphalt road, as the beach ball traveled farther on the gravel road. Option 2: gravel is the correct answer."
103,"  Given the information provided, the watermelon looks larger.

The distance from Harry to the apple is 31 feet, which is a relatively short distance. However, the distance from Harry to the watermelon is 115 feet, which is much longer. This means that the watermelon appears larger than the apple in this scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: watermelon."
104,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to convert the weight of the car and the dump truck from pounds to kilograms.

1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms

So, the weight of the car in kilograms is:

3270 pounds = 3270 x 0.453592 = 1457.6 kilograms

And the weight of the dump truck in kilograms is:

38794 pounds = 38794 x 0.453592 = 170977.6 kilograms

Now, let's compare the weights of the car and the dump truck:

Car: 1457.6 kilograms
Dump truck: 170977.6 kilograms

Since the weight of the car is less than the weight of the dump truck, the car will accelerate faster. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 1: faster."
105,"  Based on the information provided, the surface that is more smooth is the roof.

According to the question, the rain travels over the driveway in 13 seconds, which means that the driveway is rougher than the roof. The question also states that the bumpy shingles of James' house are 28 seconds faster than the driveway, which means that the shingles are smoother than the driveway.

Therefore, option 1 (roof) is the correct answer."
106,"  Based on the information provided, the shopping cart moves faster over the door mat than over the tile floor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 2: Tile floor.

As the shopping cart moves over the tile floor, it encounters more friction than over the door mat, resulting in a slower speed."
107,"  Given the weight requirement of 90000 g, the best option for Howard's new bed frame is Option 2: thin. A thin bed frame would be able to support the weight of 90000 g without compromising its structural integrity. A thick bed frame, on the other hand, might not be able to handle the weight and could potentially break or collapse under the pressure."
108,"  Based on the information provided, the dirt road has more friction than the paved road. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more friction.

When driving on a dirt road, the car heats up faster than when driving on a paved road, which suggests that there is more friction on the dirt road. Friction is the force that opposes the motion of a vehicle, and it is higher on rougher surfaces like dirt roads than on smoother surfaces like paved roads. So, the car heats up faster on the dirt road because it is working harder to overcome the increased friction."
109,"  Based on the information provided, the trolley will be able to go a greater distance on the rusted tracks.

The friction force on the rusted tracks is greater than the friction force on the new tracks, so the trolley will experience more resistance when moving along the rusted tracks. This means that the trolley will have to use more energy to overcome the friction force and maintain its speed, which will result in a shorter distance traveled.

On the other hand, the trolley will experience less friction force when moving along the new tracks, which means it will be able to travel a greater distance without expending as much energy. Therefore, the trolley will be able to go a greater distance on the new tracks.

So, the answer is Option 1: rusted tracks."
110,"  To determine which of the two animals will take longer to get home, we need to calculate their speeds and compare them.

The tortoise has a speed of 14 m/s, and the hare has a speed of 56 m/s. To find out which animal will take longer to get home, we can divide the distance between the school house and their home by each animal's speed.

Let's assume that the distance between the school house and their home is 10 kilometers (10,000 meters).

For the tortoise:

10,000 meters / 14 m/s = 714 seconds

For the hare:

10,000 meters / 56 m/s = 180 seconds

Therefore, the hare will take longer to get home than the tortoise. The hare will take 180 seconds to get home, while the tortoise will take 714 seconds to get home.

So, the answer is Option 2: Hare."
111,"  Based on the information provided, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet.

The business card has a thickness of 1.2 cm, which is equivalent to 0.47 inches. This means that the business card is thinner than the cardboard sheet, which is 1 inch thick. Therefore, the business card is less strong than the cardboard sheet.

Option 1: Business card."
112,"  To determine which will take longer to get across the tree trunk, we need to calculate the time it would take each to cover the distance.

The distance the worm needs to travel is 17 cm/s x 100 cm (the length of the tree trunk) = 1700 cm.

The distance the caterpillar needs to travel is 45 cm/s x 100 cm = 4500 cm.

Therefore, the caterpillar will take longer to get across the tree trunk than the worm.

So, the answer is Option 2: caterpillar."
113,"  Based on the information provided, the bus driver drove at a slower speed on the unpaved road (39 km/h) than on the dirt road (32 miles/h). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 2: Less friction.

The unpaved road had less friction than the dirt road, which is why the bus driver drove slower on the unpaved road."
114,"  Based on the information provided, the cherry will heat up more on the slope.

The distance the cherry can roll on a slope is 56 m, while the distance it can roll on flat ground is 4 m. This means that the cherry will cover more distance on the slope than on flat ground, which means it will experience more friction and heat up more. Therefore, option 1 (slope) is the correct answer."
115,"  According to the inverse-square law of light, the street light that is 6.2 miles away will appear brighter than the one that is 2.5 miles away.

The inverse-square law states that the intensity of light decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the source of light. In other words, as the distance from the light source increases, the light intensity decreases.

So, in this case, the street light that is 6.2 miles away is farther from John than the one that is 2.5 miles away. Therefore, the light from the 6.2-mile street light will appear brighter to John than the light from the 2.5-mile street light.

So, the correct answer is Option 1: Street light that is 6.2 miles away."
116,"  To spend less time on a trip from city to city in Japan, the traveler should choose the bullet train.

The bullet train can travel at a speed of 80 meters per second, which is much faster than the speed of a car, which is 29 meters per second. This means that the bullet train will take less time to cover the same distance as a car.

For example, if the distance between the two cities is 100 kilometers, the bullet train would take approximately 2 hours to cover that distance, while a car would take around 4 hours to cover the same distance. By choosing the bullet train, the traveler can save a significant amount of time on their trip."
117,"  To spend less time on a trip from city to city in Japan, the traveler should choose the bullet train.

The bullet train can travel at a speed of 8 miles per hour, which is much faster than the speed of a car, which is 2 meters per second. This means that the bullet train will take less time to cover the same distance as a car.

For example, if the distance between the two cities is 100 miles, the bullet train would take 8/100 = 0.08 hours (or 48 minutes) to travel between them, while the car would take 2/100 = 0.02 hours (or 12 minutes) to cover the same distance.

Therefore, the bullet train is the better option for the traveler who wants to spend less time on their trip."
118,"  To determine which robin covered more distance, we need to calculate the time it took for each robin to fly the same distance.

Let's assume that the distance the robins flew is 100 miles.

For the male robin, it took 4 hours to stop and rest, so the distance it flew in that time is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 4 miles/hour x 4 hours = 16 miles

For the female robin, it took 2 hours and 38 minutes to stop and rest, so the distance it flew in that time is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 4 miles/hour x 2 hours and 38 minutes = 11 miles

Therefore, the female robin covered more distance than the male robin.

So, the correct answer is Option 2: the female robin covered more distance."
119,"  Given the information provided, the more powerful window is the blue window.

The green window needs 1 punch each from Bill and his friend to break, which means it takes a total of 2 punches to break.

On the other hand, the blue window needs 2 punches each from Bill and his friend to break, which means it takes a total of 4 punches to break. Therefore, the blue window is the more powerful window."
120,"  Based on the information provided, the train generated more heat on the tracks.

The speed of the train on the tracks (28 mph) is lower than the speed on the pavement (68 mph), which means that the train is moving slower on the tracks than on the pavement. As the train moves slower, it will generate more heat due to friction with the tracks. Therefore, option 1, the tracks, is the correct answer."
121,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion. Let's assume that the male robin stopped for 5 minutes and the female robin kept going for 3 more minutes.

During the 5 minutes that the male robin stopped, neither of them moved. So, the distance covered by the male robin is 0 meters.

On the other hand, the female robin covered a distance of 3 minutes \* 60 meters/minute = 180 meters during the time she kept flying.

Therefore, the female robin covered more distance than the male robin.

So, the correct answer is Option 2: the female robin."
122,"  Given the information provided, the coaster will heat up more over the coffee table than over the dining table.

The speed of the coaster over the coffee table is 21 m/s, and the speed of the coaster over the dining table is 9.4 m/s. To find the difference in speed, we can subtract the speed over the dining table from the speed over the coffee table:

21 m/s - 9.4 m/s = 11.6 m/s

Since the coaster is moving faster over the coffee table than over the dining table, the coaster will heat up more over the coffee table. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: more."
123,"  Given the information provided, the Lamborghini weighs 1500 kg and the class 6 medium truck weighs around 12000 kg. To determine which option is faster in a race, we need to calculate the acceleration of each vehicle.

Acceleration is calculated by dividing the change in velocity by the time it takes to achieve that change in velocity. In this case, let's assume the race is 100 meters long.

For the Lamborghini:

* Initial velocity = 0 km/h (since it's at rest)
* Final velocity = 100 km/h (since it needs to cover 100 meters in 10 seconds)
* Time = 10 seconds

Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (100 km/h - 0 km/h) / 10 seconds = 10 km/h/s

For the class 6 medium truck:

* Initial velocity = 0 km/h (since it's at rest)
* Final velocity = 120 km/h (since it needs to cover 100 meters in 10 seconds)
* Time = 10 seconds

Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (120 km/h - 0 km/h) / 10 seconds = 12 km/h/s
"
124,"  Based on the information provided, the option that offers more resistance to the spider's temperature change is:

Option 1: web.

The temperature of the spider decreases when it is scurrying across a web, indicating that the web provides more resistance to temperature change than the tree. This makes sense, as the web is a more dense and compact structure than the tree, which would provide more resistance to heat transfer."
125,"  Based on the information provided, the train generated more heat on the tracks.

The speed of the train on the tracks (45 kph) is lower than the speed on the pavement (56 kph), which means that the train is moving slower on the tracks than on the pavement. As the train moves slower on the tracks, it will generate more heat due to friction between the train and the tracks. Therefore, option 2: tracks is the correct answer."
126,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy of an object remains constant as it moves through a system. In this case, the energy of the bowling ball is given by the equation:

E = 3J (for the green alley) or E = 16J (for the yellow alley)

We know that the bowling ball is thrown down the green alley, so the energy it has at the beginning of its motion is 3J. We also know that the energy it has at the end of its motion is 0J, because it has lost all its kinetic energy as it comes to rest. Therefore, the distance the bowling ball travels can be calculated as:

Distance = (Initial energy - Final energy) / (Kinetic energy at final velocity)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Distance = (3J - 0J) / (0.5J) = 6J

Therefore, the distance the bowling ball travels when thrown down the green alley is 6J.

Option 1 is incorrect, because the distance the bowling ball travels in the green alley is longer than the distance it travels in the yellow alley.

Option 2 is correct, because the bowling ball travel"
127,"  Based on the information provided, the dirt road has more friction than the paved road. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: more friction.

The fact that the car heats up faster on the dirt road than on the paved road suggests that the dirt road is providing more resistance to the movement of the car, which in turn causes the car to generate more heat. This is consistent with the idea that more friction means more resistance, and therefore more heat generated."
128,"  Given the information provided, the beetle will seem bigger to Jimbo.

Jimbo is 4 feet away from the beetle, which means the beetle is 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet away from Jimbo.

On the other hand, Jimbo is 100 feet away from the grasshopper, which means the grasshopper is 100 feet / 2 = 50 feet away from Jimbo.

Since the beetle is closer to Jimbo than the grasshopper, the beetle will seem bigger to Jimbo. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: beetle."
129,"  Both options are incorrect.

The apple is actually closer to Harry than the watermelon. The apple is 25 feet away, while the watermelon is 10 meters away, which is equivalent to 33 feet. So, the apple looks larger to Harry.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: apple."
130,"  To determine which option is correct, we need to convert both weights to the same unit of measurement, such as pounds or kilograms.

The participant whose weight was 38 pounds has a weight of 16.4 kilograms (38 / 2.2 = 16.4).

The participant who had a weight of 12 kilograms has a weight of 26.7 pounds (12 / 2.2 = 26.7).

Therefore, the participant whose weight was 38 pounds is more strong than the participant who had a weight of 12 kilograms.

So, the correct answer is Option 2: more."
131,"  To determine which road is more smooth, we need to compare the distance the beach ball travels on each road.

On the gravel road, the beach ball travels 4 meters when kicked across it.
On the asphalt road, the beach ball travels 6 meters when kicked across it.

Therefore, the gravel road is more smooth than the asphalt road, as the beach ball travels farther on the gravel road given the same amount of force."
132,"  To determine who went further, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each person.

Tina's cruise is 24 hours long, so she traveled for 24 hours x 35 mph = 840 miles.

Maria's cruise is 15 hours long, so she traveled for 15 hours x 35 mph = 525 miles.

Therefore, Maria went further than Tina. The correct answer is Option 2: Maria."
133,"  To determine which insect will seem bigger to Jimbo, we need to find the difference in distance between the beetle and the grasshopper.

According to the problem, Jimbo is 484 feet away from the beetle. If a quarter of 827 feet is 208 feet (since 827 / 4 = 208), then the grasshopper is 208 + 484 = 692 feet away from Jimbo.

Since 692 feet is greater than 484 feet, the grasshopper will seem bigger to Jimbo. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: grasshopper."
134,"  Based on the information provided, the floor was the smoother of the two surfaces.

When the receipt slid across the sales counter, it went a distance of 2 meters. However, when it slid across the floor, it went a distance of only 1 meter. This suggests that the floor was smoother than the sales counter, as the receipt traveled a shorter distance on the floor than on the counter. Therefore, the answer is Option 2: floor."
135,"  If Jimbo is 104 inches away from a beetle and 100 feet away from a grasshopper, the grasshopper will seem bigger to him.

Here's why:

* 104 inches is equal to 8.67 feet (since 1 inch = 0.08333333 feet).
* 100 feet is equal to 12.9549 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

So, Jimbo is 8.67 feet away from the beetle and 12.9549 inches away from the grasshopper. Since inches are smaller than feet, the grasshopper will seem bigger to Jimbo.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: grasshopper."
136,"  Based on the information provided, the bus driver drove at a slower speed on the unpaved road (30 km/h) than on the dirt road (50 km/h). This suggests that the unpaved road had:

Option 2: Less friction.

The unpaved road had less friction than the dirt road, which is why the bus driver was able to travel faster on the dirt road despite the rougher terrain. Friction is the force that opposes motion, and it is typically higher on rough or uneven surfaces than on smooth ones. Therefore, the bus driver was able to maintain a higher speed on the dirt road due to the lower friction provided by the rough terrain."
137,"  To determine which of the two animals will take longer to get home, we need to calculate their speeds and compare them.

The tortoise has a speed of 44 m/s, and the hare has a speed of 76 m/s. To find out which animal will take longer to get home, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know the distance between the school house and their homes, so we can use that to calculate the time it will take each animal to get home. Let's assume the distance between the school house and their homes is 5 kilometers (5,000 meters).

For the tortoise:
Time = 5,000 meters / 44 m/s = 114.4 seconds

For the hare:
Time = 5,000 meters / 76 m/s = 6.76 seconds

So, the hare will take significantly less time to get home than the tortoise. Therefore, the answer is Option 2: Hare."
138,"  To spend less time on the trip from city to city, the traveler should choose the bullet train. The bullet train can travel at a speed of 45 miles per hour, which is faster than the car's speed of 23 miles per hour. Therefore, the bullet train will take less time to cover the same distance as the car. So, the correct answer is Option 1: bullet train."
139,"  Option 2: The sports car would likely take off more speedily.

Here's why:

The custom tractor trailer is much larger and heavier than the Italian model sports car. As it waits at the stoplight, the trailer's weight and size create more drag, making it more difficult for the vehicle to accelerate quickly when the light turns green. In contrast, the sports car is smaller and lighter, which means it will experience less drag and can accelerate more quickly when the light turns green.

Additionally, the tractor trailer is designed for hauling heavy loads over long distances, not for speed or agility. It may have a more powerful engine, but the weight of the trailer will still limit its acceleration capabilities. The sports car, on the other hand, is designed for speed and agility, with a lighter weight and a more powerful engine, making it better suited for quick takeoffs.

Therefore, when the stoplight finally turns green, the sports car is likely to take off more speedily than the tractor trailer."
140,"  Based on the information provided, the bumpy shingles of James' house are more rough than the driveway.

According to the question, the rain travels over the driveway in 25 seconds, which means that the driveway is rougher than the shingles. The shingles take twice as long to travel over, which means they are rougher than the driveway. Therefore, option 2 (the bumpy shingles) is the correct answer."
141,"  Based on the information provided, the cherry will heat up less on the slope.

The distance the cherry can roll on a slope is 100 m, which is greater than the distance it can roll on flat ground (30 m). This means that the cherry will have to roll a longer distance on the slope to reach the same distance as it would on flat ground. As a result, the cherry will experience more friction and heat buildup on the flat ground, compared to the slope. Therefore, option 1 (slope) is the correct answer."
142,"  Given the information provided, the coaster will heat up less over the dining table than over the coffee table.

Option 2: less

Explanation:

When Milo slides the coaster over the coffee table at a speed of 20 cm/s, the coaster will cover a distance of 20 cm in 1 second. Therefore, the coaster will heat up by 20 cm x 0.2 = 4 cm per second.

When Milo slides the coaster over the dining table at a speed of 50 cm/s, the coaster will cover a distance of 50 cm in 1 second. Therefore, the coaster will heat up by 50 cm x 0.2 = 10 cm per second.

Since the coaster heats up less over the dining table than over the coffee table, the answer is Option 2: less."
143,"  Given the information provided, the watermelon is likely to look larger than the apple.

The distance between Harry and the apple is 5 feet, which is a relatively short distance. Therefore, the apple will appear relatively small compared to the watermelon, which is 10 feet away. This means that the watermelon will appear larger than the apple in Harry's field of view.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: watermelon."
144,"  Based on the information provided, the correct answer is Option 2: more resistance.

When Lyle drives the jeep on the sand, it moves at a speed of 34 km/hr, which is faster than the speed of 27 miles/hr it moves on the concrete. This means that the sand provides more resistance to the jeep's movement than the concrete."
145,"  Option 2: matte table

When you slide a lunch bag across a shiny table, the bag will experience more friction and heat buildup due to the smooth surface. This means that the bottom of the bag will get hotter faster. On the other hand, sliding the bag across a matte table will create less friction and heat buildup, resulting in a cooler bottom. Therefore, the matte table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler."
146,"  To determine which ball has weaker gravity, we need to calculate the gravitational force acting on each ball. The gravitational force is given by the equation:

F = G \* m \* M / r^2

where:

* F is the gravitational force
* G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
* m is the mass of the object
* M is the mass of the Earth (5.97237e24 kg)
* r is the distance between the object and the center of the Earth

For the softball:

m = 4 ounces = 0.0625 kg
r = distance between the softball and the center of the Earth = 0.00000625 km (assuming Janna is holding the softball at a distance of 1 meter from her body)

F = G \* m \* M / r^2 = 6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2 \* 0.0625 kg \* 5.97237e24 kg / (0.00000625 km)^2 = 0.00000000625 N

For the bowling ball:

m = 32 ounces = 0"
147,"  Given the information provided, the coaster will heat up less over the dining table than over the coffee table.

Option 2: less

Explanation:

When Milo slides the coaster over the coffee table at a speed of 1 m/s, the coaster will experience a certain amount of frictional heating due to the resistance caused by the table surface. This heating will cause the coaster to warm up.

On the other hand, when Milo slides the coaster over the dining table at a speed of 0.4 m/s, the coaster will experience even less frictional heating due to the softer surface of the dining table. As a result, the coaster will warm up less over the dining table than over the coffee table.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: less."
148,"  To determine who has a bigger gravity pull, we need to consider the mass of each person. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull will be.

Elliot weighs 180 pounds, which means he has a mass of 180 pounds x 1 unit = 180 pounds.

Leon weighs 120 pounds, which means he has a mass of 120 pounds x 1 unit = 120 pounds.

Therefore, Leon has a smaller mass than Elliot, which means he has a weaker gravitational pull. So, the correct answer is Option 2: Leon."
149,"  To determine who has a bigger gravity pull, we need to calculate their body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of a person's weight in relation to their height.

Elliot weighs 82 kg, which is equivalent to 179 pounds.
Leon weighs 167 pounds, which is equivalent to 75 kg.

Using the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters) squared, we can calculate their BMIs:

Elliot's BMI = 179 / (1.7 m) squared = 24.5
Leon's BMI = 75 / (1.7 m) squared = 24.8

As you can see, both Elliot and Leon have a BMI of approximately 24.5, which means they are both of normal weight. Therefore, neither of them has a bigger gravity pull.

So, the correct answer is: Option 2: Leon."
150,"  Based on the information provided, the bus driver drove at a slower speed on the unpaved road (37 km/h) than on the dirt road (38 miles/h). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Option 2: Less friction.

The unpaved road had less friction than the dirt road, which is why the bus driver drove slower on the unpaved road."
151,"  Based on the information provided, the train generated more heat on the tracks.

The speed of the train on the tracks (76 kph) is higher than the speed on the pavement (37 kph), which means the train is moving faster on the tracks. As the train moves faster, it will generate more heat due to friction between the wheels and the tracks. Therefore, option 1 (tracks) is the correct answer."
152,"  According to the principle of perspective, the street light that is 2 miles away will appear brighter than the one that is 1 mile away.

The reason for this is that the farther away an object is, the smaller it appears to the human eye. This is because the human eye has a limited ability to resolve details at a distance, and the farther away an object is, the more it is affected by the blurring effect of the atmosphere.

Therefore, the street light that is 2 miles away will appear larger and brighter than the one that is 1 mile away, even though they are both emitting the same amount of light."
153,"  Based on the information provided, the rocky yard is more rough than the swept yard.

According to the passage, a boxer dog can run at a speed of 42 mph in a swept yard, which suggests that the surface is smooth and flat. In contrast, the passage states that the dog can run at a speed of 38 mph in a rocky yard, which implies that the surface is rough and uneven. Therefore, option 2 (rocky yard) is the correct answer."
154,"  Option 2: matte table

When you slide a lunch bag across a shiny table, the friction between the bag and the table will cause the bag to heat up due to the frictional forces. On the other hand, when you slide a lunch bag across a matte table, the friction will be less, and the bag will heat up less. Therefore, the matte table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler."
155,"  To determine which ball has weaker gravity, we need to understand that gravity is a force that attracts objects towards each other. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them.

Since Janna is holding both the bowling ball and the softball, the distance between the balls and Janna is the same. Therefore, the gravitational force acting on both balls is the same.

So, neither the softball nor the bowling ball has weaker gravity. Both balls are attracted to Janna with the same strength.

Therefore, the correct answer is: Neither option 1 nor option 2."
156,"  Based on the information provided, the trolley will experience a greater distance on the rusted tracks.

The friction force on the rusted tracks is 12 N, which is greater than the friction force on the new tracks of 7 N. This means that the trolley will have more resistance and friction when traveling on the rusted tracks, which will cause it to slow down and travel a shorter distance.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: rusted tracks."
157,"  Given the information provided, the best answer is Option 2: thin.

Howard needed a new bed frame that could hold a weight of 120 kg, which means the frame needed to be strong enough to support that amount of weight without breaking or collapsing. A thin frame would be more likely to be able to support a heavier weight than a thick frame, as it would have a smaller cross-sectional area and therefore be able to distribute the weight more evenly.

Therefore, the best answer is Option 2: thin."
158,"  Based on the information provided, the option that offers more resistance to the spider's temperature change is:

Option 2: tree.

According to the question, the spider's temperature becomes 92 F while scurrying across a web, indicating that the web provides more resistance to temperature change than the tree."
159,"  Based on the information provided, the option that offers more resistance to the spider's temperature change is:

Option 1: web.

The temperature of the spider increases by 20°C while scurrying across the web, indicating that the web provides more resistance to temperature change than the tree. This makes sense, as the web is a more complex and dynamic structure than the tree, and would likely provide more resistance to temperature fluctuations."
160,"  Based on the information provided, the butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes.

According to the passage, the butterfly can fly at a speed of 7 miles per hour through open air, which means it generates a certain amount of heat due to its motion. However, when flying through bushes, the butterfly can fly at a speed of 18 miles per hour, which is significantly faster than its speed through open air. This increased speed means that the butterfly generates more heat while flying through the bushes compared to flying through open air. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: bushes."
161,"  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative velocity. The relative velocity between the two robins is the velocity of the female robin minus the velocity of the male robin.

Let's assume the velocity of the male robin is ""m"" and the velocity of the female robin is ""f"".

After 13 minutes, the male robin stopped to rest, so the distance traveled by the male robin is:

Distance = Speed x Time = m x 13 minutes = m x 0.22 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

The female robin kept going and didn't stop to rest for another 24 minutes, so the distance traveled by the female robin is:

Distance = Speed x Time = f x 24 minutes = f x 0.44 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Since the male robin stopped to rest after 13 minutes, the female robin covered more distance than the male robin during the same time period. Therefore, the answer is Option 2: the female robin covered more distance."
