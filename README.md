# NumEval @ SemEval - 2024: Quantitative Understanding Performance of LLMs

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our project "Unpacking Large Language Model's Performance on Quantitative Understanding: NumEval @ SemEval - 2024". This project evaluates the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on various quantitative understanding and reasoning tasks as part of the SemEval - 2024 challenges.

## Repository Structure

Within this repository, you will find the following files and directories:

- [`QA_task.py`](https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding/blob/main/QA_task.py): Python script for performing quantitative analysis tasks.
- [`QNLI.ipynb`](https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding/blob/main/QNLI.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for the Quantitative Natural Language Inference task.
- [`QP.ipynb`](https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding/blob/main/QP.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for the Quantitative Prediction task.
- [`QQA Fine Tuning.ipynb`](https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding/blob/main/QQA%20Fine%20Tuning.ipynb): Jupyter notebook detailing the fine-tuning process for the Quantitative Question Answering task.
- [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding/blob/main/requirements.txt): Contains all the necessary Python packages required to run the scripts and notebooks.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaomeng-zhu/num-understanding.git
cd num-understanding
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To reproduce the analysis and results described in our paper:

- Run `QA_task.py` for quantitative analysis tasks:
  ```bash
  python QA_task.py
  ```
- Open and run the Jupyter notebooks (`QNLI.ipynb`, `QP.ipynb`, `QQA Fine Tuning.ipynb`) to follow the methodologies used in each specific task.
