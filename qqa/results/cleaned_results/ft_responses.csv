142," Option 1: more. When the coaster moves at a slower speed over the coffee table, it will take longer to heat up, so it will heat up more over the coffee table."
143," Option 1: watermelon. The watermelon is farther away from Harry, so it appears larger. "
144, Option 2: more resistance 
145," Option 2: matte table. The matte table will make the bottom of the bag stay cooler because it has a rougher surface, which will cause the bag to heat up less than the shiny table. "
146, Option 1: softball. 
147," Option 1: more. When the coaster slides over the coffee table, it will heat up more because it has a lower speed, which means it will lose more energy. "
148," Option 2: Leon. The bigger gravity pull is on the person with more mass, which is Leon. "
149," Option 2: Leon. The bigger gravity pull is on Leon because he has a higher mass, which means he has a stronger gravitational pull."
150, Option 1: more friction 
151," Option 2: pavement. The train generated more heat on the pavement because it has a lower friction coefficient, which means it has less resistance to movement. "
152," Option 1: Street light that is 2 mile away. As the distance from the light source increases, the light appears dimmer. Therefore, the street light that is 2 miles away will appear brighter than the one that is 1 mile away. Option 2: Street light that is a mile away is incorrect because the light will appear dimmer as the distance from the light source increases, and the street light that is 1 mile away is closer to John than the one that is 2 miles away. "
153," Option 2: swept yard. The swept yard has a smoother surface, which means the dog can run faster in that area. The rocky yard has a rougher surface, which means the dog will have to work harder to move around, and will therefore run slower."
154," Option 2: matte table. The matte table has a lower friction coefficient, which means that the lunch bag will have less resistance when sliding across it. This means that the bottom of the bag will stay cooler on the matte table. "
155, Option 1: softball. 
156," Option 2: new tracks. The trolley can go a greater distance on the new tracks because it has a lower friction force, which means it will have less resistance and can move faster."
157," Option 2: thin. A thinner frame would be able to hold less weight, so it would not be able to hold the 120 kg weight. "
158," Option 2: tree. The tree offers more resistance because it has more friction than the web, which means the spider has to work harder to move around on it."
159, Option 2: tree. The web offers less resistance to the spider's movement because it is smoother and has less friction than the tree.
160," Option 1: bushes. The butterfly creates less heat flying through the bushes because it has to move through a denser medium, which creates more resistance and thus more heat. "
161," Option 2: the female. The female robin stopped to rest after 24 mins, which means it covered more distance than the male robin, which stopped after 13 mins. Therefore, the female robin covered more distance."
